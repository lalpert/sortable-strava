sortable-strava
===============

Sortable-strava is a chrome extension that allows you to view a Strava activity, and sort the segments you rode by your rank, time, and more. It replaces the columns "Power", "VAM", and "HR" with more useful data.

It also makes each column sortable so you can sort your segments by distance, rank, etc.
